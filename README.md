- **Occasion-Based Recommendations**: The chatbot can suggest clothes based on different occasions like festivals and seasons. It considers the user's input and provides appropriate recommendations.

- **Product Details and Links**: For each recommended product, the chatbot provides its details and a link to the product's website, allowing users to access more information.

- **Email Product Information**: Users have the option to receive product information via email. This functionality is achieved through Zapier integration, allowing seamless email communication.

Zapier Integration
Create a Zapier account (if not already done).

Create a new Zap and set up a trigger app. Select the trigger event, which could be an API trigger or any suitable event that notifies when an email is required to be sent.

Set up the action app as "Email by Zapier" or any other suitable app that handles email communication.

Configure the email details, including the recipient's address, subject, and content. Use the data from the trigger event to populate the email content with the product information.

In the Zapier action, include the product details and the link to the product's website, as provided by the chatbot.

Test the Zap to ensure that the email is sent correctly.
